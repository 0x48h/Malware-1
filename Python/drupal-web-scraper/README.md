# Drupal Web Scraper

ChatGPT:

This Python script appears to be a web scraper that finds Drupal websites and sends their domains to a remote server.

The script imports the necessary libraries, including Queue, Thread, urllib2, re, and socket. It then sets several variables, including threadcount (the number of threads to use), domaincount (the number of domains to scrape), timeout (the timeout for web requests), and serverurl (the URL of the remote server to send data to).

The script defines three functions: senddomains, senddrupal, and scrapedomain. senddomains sends a list of domains to the remote server, while senddrupal sends information about a Drupal website to the remote server. scrapedomain is the main function of the script, which does the actual scraping. It takes a URL from a queue, retrieves the HTML content of the page, and searches for links to other pages. If the page contains the word "Drupal" in its HTML content, it is marked as a Drupal website and its domain is sent to the remote server. The script also adds any new domains found on the page to the queue to be scraped later.

Finally, the script enters a loop where it retrieves a list of domains to scrape from the remote server, adds them to the queue, and starts multiple threads to scrape the domains in parallel. The loop waits for all threads to finish before retrieving the next batch of domains to scrape.
